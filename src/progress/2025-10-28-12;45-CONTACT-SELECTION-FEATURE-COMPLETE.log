### Phone Number Parsing Logic

The enhanced parsing handles:
- International format: +48123456789 → code: +48, number: 123456789
- Local format with prefix: 48123456789 → code: +48, number: 123456789
- Polish local format: 123456789 → code: +48, number: 123456789
- With special characters: 123-456-789 → code: +48, number: 123456789

### Next Steps

The contact selection feature is now fully functional and ready for:
1. Extension to other SMS screens (Bulk SMS, Individual SMS)
